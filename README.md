-for validation while creating the user
- Time taken: 3 hours 
- Functionality: Creating, Validating a user through the form by linking frontend with the backend (using Axios) and using MongoDB as the database to store the data through the form. It validates email and password as per the given instructions.

# TASK 4:

- Time Taken: 5 hours
- Functionality: Sending the email using Nodemailer for forget password and creating graphs using ChartJS for the dashboard. And the database can be accessed by only the privded password. Other passwords would not redirect to dashboard.
- Improvement: If the data for the graphs were passed dynamically, the other values could have been calculated by using map.
